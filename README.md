# Tetrimino
New tetris game
I copy this project in https://github.com/pkarri12/Tetrimino

I change code for holding function, but I can't

basic tetris's functions implement this project

score, level, 7's block etc.

Thank you

(this code will be clicking 'c', you have a bug)
('c' is a holding function's key)
